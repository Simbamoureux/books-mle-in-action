## What is a machine learning engineer ?

Use a system, set of standard tools, processes and methodology that aims to minimize the chances of failed ML projects. Those should prevent rework, confusion and complexity.

### Why ML Engineering ?

ML is *hard* ! Data Science knowledge doesn't help building  interfaces between the model solution and the real world. 

MLE needs to know *just enough* DE skills and Software skills to build & ship reliable systems. 

Why do projects fails ?

### Core tenets of MLE

- Planning : Cause of failure of most ML Projects, adressing the wrong problem. You have to ask the right questions to ensure that you address the right problem. Focus on *what* will be built and *why* it needs to be built. Do not adress the *how* and *when* yet to avoid diverting from the business problem.
  * What would make this project a success ?
  * How is it done today if at all ?
- Scoping and research : The project can fail by doing too few scoping and research (and develop a useless solution) or too much also (and develop a good solution but for a budget and time that far outweights the business gains.
  * We need to compromise on those 2 approaches.
- Experimentation : Here also, we need to find a balance between over-experimentation and bad experimentation. The 2 cause ML projects to fail for different reasons.

- Development : Same problem as in software engineering.
- Deployment : Always strive for the simplest design possible when building an architecture.
- Evaluation : If you can't justify the benefits in production of a ML product, it won't stay in production very long. A nearly flawless project can get cancelled if we can't justify how it contributes to the bottom line.
  * This is true for project with noticeable cost, if the cost is low enough, usually noone will notice.

### Goals of MLE

Use the process to deliver great ML projects ! ML that adresses a business problem, not the latest and greatest models, not the most shiny architecture. The goal is not a foolproof solution but a process that **increases the chances of a successful project**
